The book contains descriptions and images of the author`s built and unbuilt projects, including the Krier House and Tower in Seaside, Florida, as well as the town of Poundbury in England. Commissioned by the Prince of Wales in 1988, Krier`s design for Poundbury in Dorset has become a reference model for ecological planning and building that can meet contemporary needs.',

Drawing on decades of psychological research, he has found that the secret to productivity and success isn`t grind - it`s feeling good. If you can make your work feel good, then productivity takes care of itself. In this revolutionary book, Ali reveals how the science of feel-good productivity can transform your life. He introduces the three hidden `energisers` that underpin enjoyable productivity, the three `blockers` we must overcome to beat procrastination, and the three `sustainers` that prevent burnout and help us achieve lasting fulfilment. He recounts the inspiring stories of founders, Olympians, and Nobel-winning scientists who embody the principles of Feel-Good Productivity.
